## To Be Human

Current reputation signals used are too vague, they often lack of important details.
But we are more and more inclined to use these to judge a human being.
Humans are much more complex then just a list of credentials.

This project aims to establish a new way to issue and verify reputation signals, it aims to bring metadata to every reputation issued, so everyone can not only verify the authenticity of these signals, but also examine the metadata to determine how reputable these signals are in their own context.
